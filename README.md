## Description

In order to learn more about how to create databases in Datomic and write queries against them,
I created this set of scripts just to play around.

## Installation

1. Launch the Datomic Beanshell environment
2. Run the load-schema.bsh script

At this point, you can run the queries.bsh script with the set of queries already prepared there.
